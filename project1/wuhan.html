  	<h1>Wuhan, China</h1>
	<p>My hometown Wuhan is a city in central China. It's a huge metropolis probably bigger than Chicago but is not very famous as Beijing or Shanghai. </p>
	<p>Wuhan is divided into three parts by the Yangtze River and its largest tributary, Han river. Therefore, Wuhan is also called as "City of Rivers". </p>
	<p>The city contains many skyscrapers, foreign concession buildings, and hundreds of lakes.</p>
	<p>The Wuchang uprising in 1911 completely overthrows the five thousand years imperial rule of Chinese history. It is the proudest thing Wuhan history.</p>

	<h2>Bridges & Water</h2>
	<p>Since Wuhan is divided by rivers and lakes, there are many bridges in the city. </p>
	<p>The first bridge across the Yangtze is built-in here in 1955, this bridge is the symbol of the city.</p>

	<h2>Visit</h2>
	<p>Unlike other Chinese cities, Wuhan is not famous for the fancy shopping mall and expensive restaurant. </p>
	<p>Due to its location in central China, Wuhan combined the style of Northern and Southern China. </p>
	<p>Welcome to Wuhan if you have a chance to visit China. Enjoy the delicious food and the atmosphere of common people.</p>
