  	<h1>Wuhan, China</h1>
	<p>My hometown Wuhan is a city in central China.</p>
	<p>It's a huge metropolis but not famous as Beijing or Shanghai. </p>
	<p>The Wuchang uprising in 1911 is Wuhan's most remarkable event in Chinese history.</p>
	<p>The revolution successfully ended China's five thousand years of the imperial rule system.</p>

	<h2>Bridges & Water</h2>
	<p>Since Wuhan is divided by rivers and lakes, there are many bridges in the city. </p>
	<p>The first bridge across the Yangtze is built-in here in 1955, this bridge is the symbol of the city.</p>

	<h2>Visit</h2>
	<p>Unlike other Chinese cities, Wuhan is not famous for the fancy shopping malls and expensive restaurants. </p>
	<p>Due to its location in central China, Wuhan combined the style of Northern and Southern China. </p>
	<p>Welcome to Wuhan if you have a chance to visit China. Enjoy the delicious food and the atmosphere of common people.</p>
